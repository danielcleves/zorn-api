# ZORN

ZORN is a web application designed to help users keep track of their vehicle maintenance in a simple, organized, and preventive way.

## 🚗 What does ZORN do?

ZORN allows users to register and manage all maintenance-related information for their vehicles, including:

- Preventive and corrective maintenance  
- Upcoming maintenance reminders  
- Maintenance history  
- Insurance records  
- Technical inspections  
- Taxes and other vehicle-related obligations  

The goal is to centralize all vehicle care information in one place and reduce the risk of expensive breakdowns caused by missed maintenance.

## 👤 Who is it for?

ZORN is built for vehicle owners who want better control over their vehicles without relying on memory, notes, or scattered apps.

As a user, you will be able to:

1. Log in using email and password  
2. Add one or multiple vehicles  
3. Define a custom care plan for each vehicle:
   - Maintenance schedules  
   - Inspections  
   - Insurance and legal obligations  
4. View detailed information for each vehicle:
   - Upcoming maintenance alerts  
   - Overdue maintenance warnings  
   - Complete maintenance history  
5. Register performed maintenance and keep a clear historical record  

## ❓ Why does ZORN exist?

Many vehicle owners are unaware of what maintenance their vehicles need or when it should be done. This often leads to skipping preventive maintenance, resulting in mechanical failures that are far more expensive than timely care.

ZORN exists to reduce this problem by providing an easy-to-use tool that helps users:

- Stay informed  
- Plan ahead  
- Extend the lifespan of their vehicles  
- Avoid unnecessary repair costs
